# ASP-CRUD-Clubs
A three part series of projects for an Application Development Fundamentals course. 

This project uses a database of various tables used for a school. 
More specifically, it utilizes the 'Staff' and 'Clubs' tables to query and edit a list of active and inactive clubs at the fictional school.

Purpose: Create CRUD and QUERY pages.
- QUERY: The user is able to view active and inactive clubs at the school using a filter. 
- CRUD: The user can add new clubs, de-activate/activate existing or new clubs and update/add a designated staff member.

In order to run the files, the StarTED.bacpac file must be reverse engineered in Microsoft SQL or similar. 

Change the server path for "STDB" in StarTEDA02 > appsettings.json under "ConnectionStrings" to your local StarTED database.
